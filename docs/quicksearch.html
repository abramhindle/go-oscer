Installcanvas-mouse can be installed in various ways: Git using HTTPS: git clone https://gitlab.com/epistemex/canvas-mouse.git Git using SSH: git clone git@gitlab.com:epistemex/canvas-mouse.git Download zip archive and extract. Download tar ball and extract. UsageEasy to use: // pass in a 2D context and level option var cm = new CanvasMouse(context, {level: &quot;transforms&quot;});Then in the handler you're using pass the event to get the correct position: function someMouseOrTouchHandler(evt) { var pos = cm.getPos(evt); // ... use pos.x, pos.y here }Issues currentTransform() is not supported by all browsers at the moment. A custom solution can be used in place that is compatible will all browsers. See the issue tracker for details. LicenseReleased under MIT license.

Parameters: Name Type Argument Description context CanvasRenderingContext2D 2D context to bind to this instance options * &lt;optional&gt; options to pass when you need more than basic point conversion Properties Name Type Argument Default Description level string &lt;optional&gt; &quot;basic&quot; can be one of three values: &quot;basic&quot;, &quot;scale&quot;, &quot;transforms&quot;. &quot;basic&quot; only converts position directly relative to element's position (incl. padding and borders if any) &quot;scale&quot; also considers if canvas element is of a different size than its bitmap (context) &quot;transforms&quot; considers scale and current transforms. Note that this require either currentTransform support on the context, or the use of a custom Matrix solution (github.com/epistemex/transformation-matrix-js). matrix Matrix &lt;optional&gt; null to support broader range of browser a custom matrix object can be passed already bound to the current context (same as passed as argument). Using a custom matrix will require the transforms to be called on this instead of the context itself. Methods getPos(event) Function to convert mouse or touch position to match the context and its element scale and transforms. Parameters: Name Type Description event * event object (mouse, touch) to use for conversion Returns: object holding properties x and y with converted position matching context Type * getPosXY(x, y) Can take a custom x and y position and convert to a position matching current element scale and context transforms. Parameters: Name Type Description x number x position to convert y number y position to convert Returns: object holding properties x and y with converted position matching context Type * init() Force re-initialization. Use if canvas element has border, padding or size changed. update() Used to manually update relative position if not caught automatically by internals. × Search results Close Epistemex at GitHub "}}
