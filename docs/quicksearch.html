The object is intended to be an literal object. The default settings handle padding and borders. Properties: Name Type Argument Default Description handleScale boolean &lt;optional&gt; false handles situations where element size is different than the bitmap size. handleTransforms boolean &lt;optional&gt; false consider transforms applied to the context when calculating position. Note that this require either currentTransform support on the context, or the use of a custom Matrix solution (github.com/epistemex/transformation-matrix-js). matrix Matrix &lt;optional&gt; null to support broader range of browser a custom matrix object can be passed already bound to the current context (same as passed as argument). Using a custom matrix will require the transforms to be called on this instead of the context itself.

Installcanvas-mouse can be installed in various ways: Git using HTTPS: git clone https://gitlab.com/epistemex/canvas-mouse.git Git using SSH: git clone git@gitlab.com:epistemex/canvas-mouse.git Download zip archive and extract. Download tar ball and extract. UsageEasy to use: // pass in a 2D context and handling options var cm = new CanvasMouse(context, { handleScale: true, handleTransforms: true });Then in the handler you're using pass the event to get the correct position: function someMouseOrTouchHandler(evt) { var pos = cm.getPos(evt); // ... use pos.x, pos.y here }Issues currentTransform() is not supported by all browsers at the moment. A custom solution can be used in place that is compatible will all browsers. See the issue tracker for details. LicenseReleased under MIT license.
