Useful from simple cases where you need to adjust the position to match canvas in a web page, to more complex cases such as click-to-zoom, pan, rotate and scale scenarios. Features Efficient, causes no unneeded DOM reflows (caches key-values and handles scrolling and resizing gracefully) Handles CSS-scaled canvas element versus its bitmap size Handles transformed context Handles element padding and borders if any Handling-methods can be changed in real-time (to optimize handling). Supports the transformation-matrix-2d solution (included) for browsers without native support for currentTransform. Installcanvas-mouse can be installed in various ways: Git using HTTPS: git clone https://gitlab.com/epistemex/canvas-mouse.git Git using SSH: git clone git@gitlab.com:epistemex/canvas-mouse.git See releases for other options. UsageEasy to use: // pass in a 2D context and handling options var cm = new CanvasMouse(context, { handleScale: true, handleTransforms: true });Then in the handler you're using pass the event to get the correct position: function someMouseOrTouchHandler(evt) { var pos = cm.getPos(evt); // ... use pos.x, pos.y here }IssuesUsing mouse/touch positions with a transformed context: The currentTransform is not supported by all browsers at the moment. Our custom matrix solution can be used in place and is compatible will all browsers. Firefox is currently the only browser that support the property (but in prefixed form) but returns an Array instead of a DOMMatrix. Chrome will return a SVGMatrix, and only if experimental canvas features is enabled behind flags. We recommend therefor using the custom matrix solution as this will be cross-platform compatible and independent of browser's current status. The only drawback is that you'll call transform operations on the matrix object instead of the context (the matrix will automatically sync the context for you though).

Parameters: Name Type Argument Description context CanvasRenderingContext2D 2D context to bind to this instance options CanvasMouseOptions &lt;optional&gt; optional options object to allow for scale and transforms to be considered. Members handleScale :boolean Set or get handleScale status. Can be toggled at any time and will affect next position calculations. Type: boolean handleTransforms :boolean Set or get handleTransforms status. Can be toggled at any time and will affect next position calculations. Note that if the browser does not support currentTransform and a custom Matrix is not provided the flag will be set to false regardless. Type: boolean matrix :Matrix Set or get custom matrix object. If set will override and patch the provided matrix. Type: Matrix Methods getPos(event) Function to convert mouse or touch position to match the context and its element scale and transforms. Parameters: Name Type Description event * event object (mouse, touch) to use for conversion Returns: Type Point getPosXY(x [, y]) Pass in custom x and y point to convert to new position relative to bound context. The way it's calculated depends on the options set when creating the instance. The method can take both a Point object, or two numbers. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description x number | Point x position to convert, or if Point the x and y of the object. y number &lt;optional&gt; y position to convert (not used if Point object is provided). Returns: Type Point init() Force re-initialization. Use if canvas element have either border, padding or size changed. update() Used to manually update relative position in client if not caught automatically by internals (scroll and resize). × Search results Close Epistemex at GitHub "}}
